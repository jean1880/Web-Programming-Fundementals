			<p >
			See the animal in his cage that you built<br>
			Are you sure what side you're on?<br>
			Better not look him too closely in the eye<br>
			Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?<br>
			See the safety of the life you have built<br>
			Everything where it belongs<br>
			Feel the hollowness inside of your heart<br>
			And it's all<br>
			Right where it belongs <br>
			<br>
			<em>[Chorus:]</em><br>
			What if everything around you<br>
			Isn't quite as it seems?<br>
			What if all the world you think you know<br>
			Is an elaborate dream?<br>
			And if you look at your reflection<br>
			Is it all you want it to be?<br>
			What if you could look right through the cracks?<br>
			Would you find yourself<br>
			Find yourself afraid to see?<br>
			<br>
			What if all the world's inside of your head<br>
			Just creations of your own?<br>
			Your devils and your gods<br>
			All the living and the dead<br>
			And you're really all alone?<br>
			You can live in this illusion<br>
			You can choose to believe<br>
			You keep looking but you can't find the woods<br>
			While you're hiding in the trees<br>
			<br>
			<em>[Chorus:]</em><br>
			What if everything around you<br>
			Isn't quite as it seems?<br>
			What if all the world you used to know<br>
			Is an elaborate dream?<br>
			And if you look at your reflection<br>
			Is it all you want it to be?<br>
			What if you could look right through the cracks<br>
			Would you find yourself<br>
			Find yourself afraid to see?
